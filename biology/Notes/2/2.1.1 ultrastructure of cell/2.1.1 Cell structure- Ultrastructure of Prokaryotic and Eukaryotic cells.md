# cells 
Can be [[prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryotic]] 
## Prokaryotic
[[prokaryotic]] [[cell]]s are always [[unicellular]] and have simple structure with undivided area inside called [[cytoplasm]] and no [[nucleus]]

Can be [[bacteria]] 
## eukaryotic 
[[eukaryotic]] [[cell]]s have [[nucleus]] and can be [[unicellular]] or [[multicellular]]. 

Following kingdoms are made up of [[eukaryotic]] [[cell]]s
- [[animal kingdom]]
- [[plant kingdom]]
- [[fungi kingdom]]
- [[protoctista kingdom]]
### features found in eukaryotic cells
- [[cytoplasm]]
- [[cell-surface membrane]]
- [[nucleus]]
- [[ribosome]]
- [[endoplasmic reticulum]]
- [[golgi apparatus]]
- [[mitochondria]]

## [[cytoskeleton]]
Does the following:
* mechanical strength, support, stability, and shape 
* transport within [[cell]]
* movement of [[cell]]

## other structures 
- [[cell wall]]
### [[production, transport and secretion of extracellular proteins]]
Involves [[nucleus]] > [[ribosome]] > [[Rough endoplasmic reticulum]] > [[golgi apparatus]] > [[cell-surface membrane]]
