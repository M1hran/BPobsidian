also known as plasma membrane

* Is a boundary between the [[cell]] and its environment
* is selectivity permeable (avoid saying partially permeable because that implies half permeable while reality is that it can choose what to allow through)
* is a site for chemical reactions
* is a site for cell to cell signaling
* it is a dynamic structure (can change shape for example in [[phagocytosis]])
* the surface area can be hugely increased with [[villi]] and [[micro villi]]
